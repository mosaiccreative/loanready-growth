# LoanReady Growth: Shark Tank Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: The Hook

### 660,000 Profitable Restaurants Can't Get Growth Loans

**The $45 Billion Problem:** There are 660,000 profitable restaurants in America that can't get loans for growth. Not because they're failing—because banks don't understand their business model.

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Meet Priya Shah - Mumbai Spice Kitchen, Austin, TX

**The Reality:**
- Monthly Revenue: $45,000
- Monthly Net Profit: $8,000
- Banks Denied: 3 applications
- Reason: DSCR of 1.15 (banks want 1.25+)

**Priya's Frustration:**
> "My restaurant is profitable, but banks say my DSCR is too low. They want 1.25+ but won't tell me specifically how to get there. Every month I wait costs me $12K in potential revenue from my second location."

**The Market Pain:**
- 40% of restaurants need growth capital
- Average wait time: 8-14 months for approval
- 65% give up after first denial
- **Total addressable market: $40 billion**
