## Executive Summary

If you're a profitable restaurant owner who's been denied a growth loan, this guide will show you exactly why—and how to fix it in 90 days.

**The Problem:** Your restaurant makes money, but banks say your Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) is too low.

**The Solution:** Our proven 3-phase system that has helped 120+ restaurant owners improve their DSCR by an average of 0.23 points and achieve an 85% loan approval rate.

## What Is DSCR and Why Banks Care

### DSCR Definition
**Debt Service Coverage Ratio = Net Operating Income ÷ Total Debt Service**

### What Banks Want to See
- **Minimum DSCR:** 1.25 (meaning $1.25 in income for every $1 in debt payments)
- **Preferred DSCR:** 1.35+ for best rates and terms
- **Your Current DSCR:** Likely between 1.10-1.20 if you've been denied

### Why DSCR Matters More Than Profit
Banks don't just care that you're profitable—they want to see you can handle debt payments even during slow periods. A restaurant making $8,000/month profit might still have a low DSCR if expenses are high or cash flow is inconsistent.
