## Customer & Problem

### Customer Profile: Priya Shah Narrative

Meet Priya Shah, owner of "Mumbai Spice Kitchen" in Austin, Texas. She's been running her restaurant for 3 years, serving authentic Indian cuisine to a loyal customer base. Despite consistent $45K monthly revenue and $8K net profit, three banks have denied her $150K expansion loan.

**Priya's Frustration:**
- "My restaurant is profitable, but banks say my DSCR is too low at 1.15"
- "They want 1.25+ but won't tell me specifically how to get there"
- "I know I can increase sales, but I'm flying blind without data"
- "Every month I wait costs me $12K in potential revenue from my second location"

**Need** a clear, measurable path to improve their debt service coverage ratio

## Shark Tank Pitch Script

### The Hook (30 seconds)
"Hi Sharks, I'm [Name] and I'm here to solve a $45 billion problem. There are 660,000 profitable restaurants in America that can't get loans for growth. Not because they're failing - because banks don't understand their business model."

### The Problem (45 seconds)
"Meet Priya. Her restaurant makes $8,000 profit every month, but three banks denied her expansion loan. Why? Her debt service coverage ratio is 1.15, and banks want 1.25. Priya knows she can increase sales, but she doesn't know specifically what banks want to see."

"LoanReady Growth gives restaurant owners like Priya a 90-day sprint to become bankable. We analyze their financials, implement proven sales strategies, and track their DSCR improvement in real-time. In 90 days, Priya went from 1.15 to 1.38 DSCR and got approved for her $150K loan."
